                <h2>Sri Lankan Traditional Fighting Style</h2>
                <p>Sri Lanka has an ancient martial art known as Angampora 🗡️.
                    It combines hand-to-hand combat, weapon techniques, and body control 🤸‍♂️.
                    Warriors train in stances, strikes, locks, and pressure points to disable opponents 💥.
                    There are also graceful movements inspired by animals and nature 🐅🌿.
                    In ancient times, Angampora was used by Sinhala warriors to defend the kingdom 🏹.
                    Training also focuses on discipline, meditation, and inner strength 🧘‍♂️🔥.
                    Traditional weapons like swords, staffs, and daggers are also part of the art ⚔️.
                    Today, Angampora is preserved as a cultural heritage and revived for future generations 🇱🇰✨.</p>

                <p>Sri Lanka has a rich martial history, and its traditional weapons reflect the skills and creativity of 
                    ancient warriors ⚔️. One of the most iconic weapons is the kastane, a beautifully decorated curved 
                    sword often carried by noble fighters 🗡️. Warriors also used the elephant goad (ankus) and the mace
                     (molaya) for close combat 💥. In the martial art Angampora, weapons such as spears, bows, daggers,
                      and the surul val (whip sword) are used with speed and precision 🎯. Shields were crafted to protect 
                      warriors, often decorated with cultural patterns 🛡️. Many of these weapons were not only tools of war,
                       but symbols of honor and craftsmanship, representing Sri Lanka’s warrior heritage 🇱🇰✨.</p>
