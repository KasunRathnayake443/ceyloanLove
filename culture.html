                    <h2>Ancient Civilizations</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sri Lanka’s cultural roots stretch back over 2,500 years. Ancient kingdoms such as
                        Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa were centers of advanced irrigation, architecture, and governance.
                        Massive stupas, moonstones, and royal palaces still stand as testaments to a highly developed civilization.

                    <p>
                        Buddhism is deeply woven into Sri Lankan life. Sacred sites such as the Temple of the Tooth Relic
                        in Kandy and the Sri Maha Bodhi Tree attract pilgrims from around the world.
                        Daily rituals, meditation, and festivals promote values of peace, compassion, and mindfulness.
