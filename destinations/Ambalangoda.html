    <p class="intro">
        Ambalangoda, located on Sri Lanka’s southwest coast, is famous for its ancient 
        tradition of handcrafted wooden masks. These masks are more than works of art — 
        they represent deep cultural, spiritual, and theatrical roots tied to folklore, 
        healing rituals, and historic performing arts.
    </p>

    <h2>Masks of Sri Lanka: Art, Ritual & Storytelling</h2>
    <p>
        The Ambalangoda mask is one of Sri Lanka's most iconic and recognizable 
        traditional crafts. More than mere souvenirs, these vibrant, often dramatic masks 
        are three-dimensional storybooks carved from local wood, deeply rooted in the 
        island's folk religion, healing rituals, and performing arts. The coastal town 
        of Ambalangoda, between Colombo and Galle, is the undisputed epicenter of this 
        centuries-old craft.

    <h2>The Essence & Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>
        These masks are not decorative objects in their original context. They are powerful 
        ritual tools believed to embody spiritual forces. When worn by a trained dancer or 
        exorcist (edura), the mask is thought to transform the wearer into the character or 
        deity it represents, channeling its energy for healing, protection, or storytelling.

    <h2>Local Craftsmanship & Wood Carving Techniques</h2>
    <p>
        Skilled artisans use traditional tools and natural materials, carving masks from 
        lightweight kaduru wood. After shaping, masks are painted with vivid natural dyes, 
        each color holding symbolic meaning. This craftsmanship has been passed down through 
        generations in Ambalangoda.

    <h2>Rituals, Performances & Healing Traditions</h2>
    <p>
        Ambalangoda masks appear in cultural performances like Kolam, Sanni Yakuma, and 
        Devil Dance rituals, which blend healing practices with theatrical drama to address 
        illness, misfortune, and spiritual imbalance.
