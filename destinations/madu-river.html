        The Madu River Boat Safari, located near Balapitiya on Sri Lanka’s
        southwest coast, offers a peaceful and immersive journey through
        mangrove forests, islands, and diverse wildlife. It is one of the
        country’s most popular eco-tourism experiences.
    </p>

    <h2>Madu Ganga Wetland Sanctuary</h2>
    <p>
        Madu Ganga is a protected wetland ecosystem recognized for its
        biodiversity. The river network consists of narrow waterways,
        mangrove tunnels, and over 60 small islands scattered throughout the
        lagoon.

    <h2>Mangrove Forests</h2>
    <p>
        The dense mangrove forests act as natural nurseries for fish and
        crustaceans. As your boat glides through shaded canals, you may spot
        water monitors, kingfishers, herons, and other wetland birds.

    <h2>Cinnamon Island</h2>
    <p>
        One of the highlights of the safari is a visit to Cinnamon Island,
        where traditional methods of peeling and processing cinnamon are
        demonstrated by local villagers.

    <h2>Fish Therapy & Island Temples</h2>
    <p>
        Visitors often stop at small island temples and experience natural
        fish therapy, where tiny fish gently exfoliate the skin — a unique
        and relaxing part of the journey.
