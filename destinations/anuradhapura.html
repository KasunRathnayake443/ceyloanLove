    <p class="intro">
        Anuradhapura is more than ruins—it's where Sri Lanka's heart still beats strong. 
        Walk in the footsteps of ancient kings, meditate beneath sacred Bodhi trees, 
        and witness living traditions that have endured for over two millennia. This 
        sacred city doesn’t just show you history—it lets you feel it in every stone, 
        every prayer, and every sunset over ancient stupas.
    </p>

    <h2>Discover Sri Lanka's First Kingdom</h2>
    <p>
        As the island’s first capital and one of the world’s oldest continuously 
        inhabited cities, Anuradhapura stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
        It whispers stories from over 2,500 years ago—stories of powerful kings, 
        remarkable architecture, and a deep spiritual culture that shaped Sri Lanka’s identity.
    </p>

    <h2>Living Spiritual Heritage</h2>
    <p>
        Anuradhapura is not just archaeological—it remains an active Buddhist 
        pilgrimage site. Devotees dressed in white offer flowers and prayers at 
        massive stupas and sacred shrines, creating a serene and spiritual atmosphere 
        felt by visitors from around the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Sacred Bodhi Tree</h2>
    <p>
        One of the city’s greatest treasures is the Sri Maha Bodhi, believed to be 
        the oldest recorded tree in the world. It was grown from a sapling of the 
        very tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment—making it one of the 
        holiest pilgrimage sites in Buddhism.
    </p>
